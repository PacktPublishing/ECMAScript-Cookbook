# ECMAScript Cookbook
This is the code repository for [ECMAScript Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/ecmascript-cookbook?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788628174), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
JavaScript permeates the development landscape like few languages before it. Since the introduction of the Node.js run-time in May of 2009, it has ventured far beyond the browser. It now works with controllers on a Raspberry Pi, as the scripting language for 3D video games that run on desktop computers, running web servers that serve millions of page views a day, and, of course, it is the dominant language for web browsers. It is possible that JavaScript is the most important programming language in the world.

The ECMAScript standard has been around almost as long as JavaScript. However, in the last few years, it has seen a flurry of activity. ES6, published in 2015, created an almost completely new language. Since then, the updates have been more gradual, but still significant. This book covers the standard up to ES8 (released in 2017). We'll discuss how to use some of its new features to organize programs more effectively and write better code.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
// hello.js 
export function sayHi () { 
  console.log('Hello, World'); 
} 
```

This book assumes that you have some very basic knowledge and resources in order to get the most out of it:

A computer with permission to install programs and configure browsers
A text editor you are comfortable with; there are a lot of options to choose from:
VSCode
Atom
Vim
Emacs
Some basic programming knowledge. If you haven't written a function before, this might not be the best place to start.
